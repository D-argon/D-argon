Hey, I’m @D-argon

- I'm new to "dev'ing", my native language is **pt-br**, but I can handle **en** too as seen!
- I'm into drawing, horror and obvsiously coding. Mostly I enjoy *Front-end*, but aim for *Fullstack* and maybe *gamedev*.
- I'm studying at an online programming course called Alura, learning bits of everything, but I expect to be in university by next year!
